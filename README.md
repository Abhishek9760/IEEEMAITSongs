# IEEEMAITSongs

This is a very basic approch to get the lyrics of the song provided the artist name and title of the song. Though I was not able accomplish all the task because of shortage of time, but atleast I had to show whatever I have done and how my soluton still works good!

# Tech Stack
Being a python developer I don't have any idea of javascript. So I used Brython which transcripts the Python code to equivalent Javascript code. Overall things used:
- Brython: Handling the API calls 
- HTML: Basic web structure
- CSS: Some refining
- Github pages: For deployment purpose making it working 24x7!
- Lyrics API: Which returns the results
